I wrote this project for interest, it's a small project, only works with an external API. Another reason to write this project is to consolidate knowledge, I wrote this project myself, without anyone's help in order to understand how to work with external APIs and FLask.
I used Flash, Bootstrap for styling, API for working with quotes: [GitHub](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) и модуль requests для работы с API.
